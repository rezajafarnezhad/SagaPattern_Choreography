Saga Pattern - Choreography with RabbitMQ and EF Core

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Saga Pattern (Choreography-based) using RabbitMQ and EF Core. The goal is to manage distributed transactions across multiple microservices without a central orchestrator.

âœ¨ Features:

Choreography-based Saga for handling distributed transactions
RabbitMQ as the event-driven messaging system
EF Core for data persistence
Resilient and scalable approach for microservices coordination
This implementation ensures eventual consistency and enables services to communicate asynchronously while maintaining a loosely coupled architecture.
